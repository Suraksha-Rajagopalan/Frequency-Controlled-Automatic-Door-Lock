## Abstract
This project utilizes the IC 4017, a decade counter with 10 outputs that sequentially turn on as the clock input at pin 14 is changed. When the clock input is modified, the output progresses to the next pin. Additionally, IC 358, a dual op-amp comparator, is employed to compare voltage levels at its inverting and non-inverting input pins. The output of the comparator depends on the voltage disparity between these inputs. Upon initial power-up, the condenser microphone does not detect any sound, resulting in a high resistance and low voltage level at pin 2 (Vref) compared to pin 3 (Vin). Consequently, the output remains low. However, when a frequency is detected by the condenser microphone, the resistance between Vcc and pin 2 decreases, causing the voltage level at pin 2 to rise above that at pin 3. This triggers a change in the output from low to high. By connecting the output of pin 2 to a transistor (Q3) and a relay, the frequency serves as a switch to activate or deactivate an appliance. The transistor turns on and off based on the output of pin 2, subsequently controlling the relay, thus enabling the appliance to be switched on or off by the desired frequency.

## Introduction
This project presents a fascinating application of sound detection technology combined with frequency input to control an appliance. By utilizing a combination of integrated circuits, namely the IC 4017 and IC 358, along with other essential components, this project demonstrates an innovative way to interact with appliances based on specific sound frequencies. The foundation of this project lies in the ability of a condenser microphone to detect sound signals. When no sound is present, the circuit maintains a low voltage level due to the high resistance in the condenser microphone. However, upon detecting the desired frequency, the resistance decreases, resulting in an
increased voltage level. This change is detected by the comparator (IC 358), which transitions from a low output state to a high output state. The transition in the comparator's output triggers a clock signal that is routed to the IC 4017, a decade counter. This counter sequentially activates its outputs, providing a systematic progression. Notably, when the counter reads 0 counts, the corresponding output, connected to pin 2, undergoes a transition from low to high. This transition then activates a transistor (Q3) which, in turn, triggers the activation of a relay.The relay acts as a switch, granting control over the state of the appliance. When the relay is activated, the appliance is turned on, and when it is deactivated, the appliance is turned off. Consequently, the entire process of sound detection, frequency analysis, and output manipulation enables users to control the appliance's operation by simply supplying the desired frequency. To ensure reliable and stable operation, various supporting components are employed, including the diode 1N4007, which rectifies the current flow, converting the alternating current into a direct current signal. Additionally, resistors and capacitors may be utilized to stabilize voltage levels, limit current flow, and mitigate noise interference.

This project utilizes sound detection through a condenser microphone and a comparator to control an appliance based on frequency input. The condenser microphone detects sound, and the comparator's output undergoes a change when the desired frequency is detected. This change in output triggers a clock signal that advances the outputs of a decade counter, specifically the IC 4017. As the counter progresses, it eventually activates a transistor and relay, thereby turning the appliance on. Reversing the clock signal subsequently deactivates the appliance. The diode 1N4007, along with other supporting components, ensures the proper supply of voltage and stability within the circuit. In summary, this project employs sound frequency detection to regulate the appliance's operation by controlling the counter and relay, while the diode serves the purpose of rectifying current flow.
